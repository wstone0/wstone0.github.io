If this threshold were to be breached with any regularity, it would have profound implications for the way we could live our lives outdoors. For instance, municipal services, such as garbage collection, might have to be reduced or suspended in such a scenario. As such, Georgia Tech’s Urban Climate Lab set out to answer the obvious question: when may this critical limit be reached? I assisted the Urban Climate Lab in acquiring, cleaning and wrangling the data for the Human Heat Tolerance Index, which tracks wet bulb temperatures in the 25 largest cities in the US. According to the analysis, over a dozen major metropolises may be at risk of threshold heat events within the decade."

    "text": "Exploratory Analysis\nTo answer these questions, I compared presidential election results, from MIT’s Election Data and Science Lab, to 538’s state urbanization index, calculated as the natural logarithm of the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident in each census tract in that state. This is a great dataset, because it is not sample data; it represents exactly what we are trying to study. Because of this, we can more confidently draw conclusions from analysis of the data. To start, let’s look at the most recent election. Here the conventional wisdom certainly holds up well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph, each dot is a state (or DC), and its position is determined by what percentage of the vote it gave to Joe Biden versus its urbanization score. The graph shows a pretty clear positive trend (r = 0.72); the more urban a state, the larger percentage of Democratic ballots, generally speaking. The only big outliers are Vermont, which despite being the fifth-most rural state gave Biden more than 65% of the vote, and DC, which is by far the most urban and most Democratic-leaning “state” (for the purposes of the electoral college). And since third parties are typically all but irrelevant, it’s unsurprising that the converse is true for Republican vote share, with nearly as strong of a negative relationship (r = -0.70)."

    "section": "The Bigger Picture",
    "text": "The Bigger Picture\nSo we have a clear answer to our first question: the urban-rural divide is a very real phenomenon in today’s politics. The natural question, then, is how exactly this came about. To get a rough estimate, I calculated the r-values in a similar manner as above for each presidential election going back to 1976, the earliest year in the dataset. A higher r-value on the y-axis corresponds to a greater correlation between state urbanization and Democratic vote share in that year’s presidential election. Notably, this is an imperfect method because the urbanization index relies on data from the 2010 census. However, the numbers likely wouldn’t be that different. New York and New Jersey were still very urban fifty years ago, and Wyoming and Montana were (and are) almost entirely rural. Keeping this caveat in mind, the remarkable strength of the correlation (r = 0.93!) shown in the graph still tells a compelling story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidently America’s geographic divide is a relatively recent phenomenon. Why might this be? The Democratic party has long been the party of the big cities, but for a long time it was also the party of the rural south. In the wake of the civil rights movement, that began to change, and by the new milennium, southern states were solidly Republican. And more recently, the suburbs, long a bastion of conservative politics, have begun to shift more towards Democrats, motivated in part by dislike of President Trump and his policies. So now it is possible to say that, with few exceptions, rural states vote Republican and urban states vote Democratic."

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nWhy is this analysis important? For one, it shows where both parties should look to gain an edge in future elections. Republicans should try to make inroads in cities, and Democrats should try to win back some rural constituencies. But more importantly, it poses a problem for the way our political system is set up. The electoral college made a lot of sense in 1788, when the states weren’t really so united at all, and small states were genuinely worried about being dominated by their larger neighbors. In 2024, state lines have mostly lost their significance, and no one talks about big states versus small states. Even for a long time after the electoral college became obsolete, its inequities didn’t matter much, because they didn’t translate to an advantage for one party or the other. But now Republican presidential candidates have a significant systemic advantage over their Democratic opponents before the campaigns even start (and even more so in the Senate). And twice in recent memory, 2000 (r = 0.70) and 2016 (r = 0.75), this advantage has been enough to swing the electoral college to a candidate who lost the popular vote. Of course this isn’t even considering the other big problem; that campaigns only need to worry about a few “swing” states which both parties have a chance of winning, and can ignore the rest of the country. The president represents all Americans equally. So why isn’t he elected by them all equally? The popular vote is simple, decisive, and takes no account of geography. This data should present compelling evidence that we should ditch the electoral college in favor of it."

To keep things simpler, I chose to only include gold medals (it hardly seems fair to count them the same as silvers and bronzes), and, also in the interest of fairness, I combined the Soviet Union with Russia and East Germany with Germany. Unsurprisingly, the US has far and away the most total gold medals; almost twice as many as its nearest competitor, Russia. But this is only part of the story.

Also, the medal counts in 1980 and 1984 are somewhat skewed by boycotts of the US and Soviet Union, respectively. But on the whole, this graph confirms the answer to our question: clearly the US has been the only truly dominant power in the Summer Olympics since its inception. Though we haven’t won the most gold medals every year, and at times other teams, such as Germany, Russia, and more recently, China, have been formidable rivals, only America has been near the top of the leaderboard pretty much invariably. It will be interesting to see if this lasts for future Olympics."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe result was quite surprising. Initially, I expected the starting advantage to increase with rating, because beginners will typically squander it fairly early with a major mistake, whereas grandmasters quite often can convert that half-pawn edge into a decisive lead. But in fact, the opposite occurs: white players below 1600 have about a 3% advantage, but by the time they reach 2000, it all but disappears. Why might this be? My initial reaction was that perhaps the matching algorithm automatically assigned white to the lower-ranked player, or else tried to adjust for the starting advantage, but the data does not bear this out:\n\n\n[1] 1595\n\n\n[1] 1591\n\n\n[1] 2112\n\n\n[1] 2116\n\n\nThe first two numbers are the overall average ratings for both colors, and the second two represent the same for the experts; in both cases, they are practically identical. As the sample size is large, with over 15,000 games, there should be an explanation for even these modest differences in winrate. The only hypothesis I can come up with is that possibly at the highest levels, there’s more experimentation, which means the white player might intentionally choose openings which erase their advantage for a more interesting game. If this is the case, the solution would be to find a dataset of tournament matches where the players almost certainly gave it their all. But as it stands, this analysis is sufficient to show that if you’re queueing into Lichess at a ranking above 2000, you can’t complain about losing the coin flip."

    "text": "Methodology\nFirst, I retrieved urbanization numbers updated with 2020 census data from 538. Next, I computed the urbanization index for the US as a whole, to have a baseline to compare the states to. From these numbers, I obtained an “urban lean” for each state, showing how much more urban or rural it is than the country as a whole. This metric corresponds to the “partisan lean” calculated by 538, Cook, and others, which tells how much redder or bluer a state is from the baseline. So once I rescaled according to 2020 results, I had an “urban-partisan lean” for each Electoral College “state” (negative numbers indicate Republican advantage).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nUrban-Partisan Lean\nPredicted Outcome\nState\nUrban-Partisan Lean\nPredicted Outcome\n\n\n\n\nAlaska\nR+45.7\nR+44.5\nNebraska\nR+12.85\nR+11.65\n\n\nAlabama\nR+22.43\nR+21.23\nNew Hampshire\nR+17.76\nR+16.56\n\n\nArkansas\nR+29.04\nR+27.84\nNew Jersey\nD+25.14\nD+26.34\n\n\nArizona\nD+8.63\nD+9.83\nNew Mexico\nR+17.51\nR+16.31\n\n\nCalifornia\nD+23.95\nD+25.15\nNevada\nD+17.38\nD+18.58\n\n\nColorado\nD+5.78\nD+6.98\nNew York\nD+32.25\nD+33.45\n\n\nConnecticut\nD+7.7\nD+8.9\nOhio\nR+1.34\nR+0.14\n\n\nDelaware\nD+0.56\nD+1.76\nOklahoma\nR+16.82\nR+15.62\n\n\nFlorida\nD+10.71\nD+11.91\nOregon\nR+3.01\nR+1.81\n\n\nGeorgia\nR+4.3\nR+3.1\nPennsylvania\nD+3.91\nD+5.11\n\n\nHawaii\nD+3.42\nD+4.62\nRhode Island\nD+14.84\nD+16.04\n\n\nIowa\nR+24.72\nR+23.52\nSouth Carolina\nR+13.55\nR+12.35\n\n\nIdaho\nR+20.3\nR+19.1\nSouth Dakota\nR+40.99\nR+39.79\n\n\nIllinois\nD+13.13\nD+14.33\nTennessee\nR+13.14\nR+11.94\n\n\nIndiana\nR+9.83\nR+8.63\nTexas\nD+5.88\nD+7.08\n\n\nKansas\nR+15.99\nR+14.79\nUtah\nD+3.5\nD+4.7\n\n\nKentucky\nR+19.43\nR+18.23\nVirginia\nD+0.62\nD+1.82\n\n\nLouisiana\nR+12.99\nR+11.79\nVermont\nR+39.32\nR+38.12\n\n\nMassachusetts\nD+16.77\nD+17.97\nWashington\nD+4.75\nD+5.95\n\n\nMaryland\nD+14.54\nD+15.74\nWisconsin\nR+14.3\nR+13.1\n\n\nMaine\nR+35.91\nR+34.71\nWest Virginia\nR+33.71\nR+32.51\n\n\nMichigan\nR+2.6\nR+1.4\nWyoming\nR+49.85\nR+48.65\n\n\nMinnesota\nR+7.7\nR+6.5\nNE 01\nR+0.93\nD+0.27\n\n\nMissouri\nR+12.23\nR+11.03\nNE 02\nD+18.66\nD+19.86\n\n\nMississippi\nR+35.04\nR+33.84\nNE 03\nR+55.07\nR+53.87\n\n\nMontana\nR+44.73\nR+43.53\nME 01\nR+22.52\nR+21.32\n\n\nNorth Carolina\nR+9.78\nR+8.58\nME 02\nR+49.29\nR+48.09\n\n\nNorth Dakota\nR+35.14\nR+33.94\nDistrict of Columbia\nD+48.43\nD+49.63\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a partisan lean alone isn’t enough to tell you what will happen; it only predicts results in a neutral national environment. Thankfully, there are ample polls at both the national and state levels available for public consumption. The national average on 270towin was Harris +2.6% on the day of writing this (NOTE: her lead would shrink to 1.2% by election day, this is the number now reflected in the data). Now the model is giving real predictions. By and large they are reasonable, but there are some eye-raising outliers (Utah D+5? Vermont R+38???). In its current state, the model is just a representation of the national mood, and a fairly crude one at that. So I decided to take things a step further, and average the urban-partisan predictions with current state polling, which can hopefully account more for local trends. In turn, however, the polls are flawed in that they sometimes make incorrect assumptions about the overall environment. The urban-partisan lean can then be seen as adjusting the polls on the assumption that urbanization is the main plotline of the 2024 election (which could very well turn out not to be the case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nPredicted Outcome\nState\nPredicted Outcome\n\n\n\n\nDistrict of Columbia\nD+68.16\nNew Mexico\nR+5.15\n\n\nCalifornia\nD+24.98\nNew Hampshire\nR+5.78\n\n\nNew York\nD+23.47\nWisconsin\nR+6\n\n\nMassachusetts\nD+22.83\nNE 01\nR+7.41\n\n\nMaryland\nD+21.47\nMissouri\nR+11.27\n\n\nNew Jersey\nD+21.07\nSouth Carolina\nR+12.03\n\n\nHawaii\nD+17.01\nIndiana\nR+12.57\n\n\nRhode Island\nD+16.27\nMaine\nR+13.05\n\n\nIllinois\nD+15.62\nUtah\nR+13.65\n\n\nNE 02\nD+14.13\nIowa\nR+14.11\n\n\nWashington\nD+13.47\nNebraska\nR+14.32\n\n\nConnecticut\nD+12.45\nKansas\nR+14.7\n\n\nDelaware\nD+10.13\nLouisiana\nR+15.2\n\n\nNevada\nD+8.99\nOklahoma\nR+15.81\n\n\nColorado\nD+8.49\nTennessee\nR+17.62\n\n\nOregon\nD+5.09\nArkansas\nR+21.42\n\n\nArizona\nD+4.06\nKentucky\nR+22.12\n\n\nVirginia\nD+3.81\nAlabama\nR+23.31\n\n\nFlorida\nD+2.86\nME 02\nR+24.54\n\n\nME 01\nD+2.84\nIdaho\nR+24.9\n\n\nPennsylvania\nD+2.56\nMississippi\nR+25.17\n\n\nMichigan\nD+0.2\nAlaska\nR+26.25\n\n\nMinnesota\nR+0.15\nWest Virginia\nR+29.75\n\n\nTexas\nR+0.16\nNorth Dakota\nR+30.47\n\n\nGeorgia\nR+2.15\nMontana\nR+30.77\n\n\nVermont\nR+3.06\nSouth Dakota\nR+32.79\n\n\nOhio\nR+3.92\nWyoming\nR+45.98\n\n\nNorth Carolina\nR+4.94\nNE 03\nR+53.53"

    "text": "Analysis\nIncorporating 270towin’s averages where available (and using 2020 results in the noncompetitive states where they aren’t), the model spits out predictions more in the realm of plausibility, but still has plenty of hot takes. For Democrats, there’s a lot to like. The model predicts Harris retaining the crucial states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, and snatching Florida back, coming tantalizingly close in vote-rich Texas and Ohio as well. There are silver linings for Republicans as well. The “Blue Wall” cracks, with Wisconsin turning red and Michigan and Minnesota essentially tied. Trump also flips Georgia, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont, while keeping remarkably close in Oregon. While the Vermont number is pure fantasy, and a reminder that these “predictions” are meant to be held with a certain degree of skepticism, Oregon is a spicy pick which I like quite a bit. Though it’s often lumped in with its more urban neighbors, Washington and California, as a West Coast liberal haven, in reality Oregon is much more rural, and its major metropolis, Portland, has suffered the past four years from ultra-liberal policies implemented in the wake of 2020. As a result, although Biden won it by 16 points in 2020, two years ago the Democrat only won the governer’s race by 3.5%, which is pretty in-line with what the model predicts. However, overall the unavoidable problem for Republicans is that these states are all pocket change compared to the electoral behemoths of Florida, Texas and Ohio, worth a combined 89 votes, and which are critical parts of any winning Republican coalition. And sure enough, when we plug in electoral votes, the model predicts a Kamala Harris victory.\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Candidate Votes\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Harris      283\n2 Trump       255\n\n\nHowever, the number of close state contests means this could easily turn into a blowout one way or the other. The polls underestimated Trump by a little over 4% in 2020: a similar shift would flip Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, Arizona and Maine’s 1st district for good measure, giving him a decisive 344-194 edge. Conversely, a similar-sized shift toward Harris would bring Minnesota, Texas, Georgia, Vermont and Ohio into her column for a whopping 369-169 rout, which would be the biggest this century."

    "text": "Conclusion\nHow seriously should these predictions be taken? Mostly, this was just an exercise to satisfy my curiosity, and I wouldn’t put too much weight in the exact numbers. However, there are some reasons to think that it might be more accurate than it seems. For one, there’s my previous project, which showed that urbanization is a strong predictor of election results. It also has an advantage over other commonly-used predictors, such as race, gender or education, in that where you live is something you can change. But no one explanatory variable can possibly capture the collective consciousness of 330 million Americans. At the end of the day, the only way to know for sure who will win is to wait for all the votes to be cast and counted."

The model correctly called 46 of 56 states and districts, but considering there were only about 10 “swing states” to begin with, any reasonably informed observer could’ve done better. And indeed, the much more intricate models at Silver Bulletin, 538, etc. were far more accurate.\nHowever, I can claim some prescience about why my model failed. These predictions were predicated on the continuance of the remarkably strong trend of increased urban-rural political polarization which I observed in “The Urban-Rural Divide in American Politics.” A simple linear regression predicted that the correlation coefficient between urbanization and Democratic vote share would jump to around 0.8 in 2024. Instead, the opposite happened.\n\ncor(newresults_clean$urbanindex, newresults_clean$pct_dem_2024)\n\n[1] 0.6067998\n\n\nThe major story of the 2024 election was minority groups, especially Hispanics, swinging sharply rightward, and as minorities tend to live in urban areas, decreased racial polarization led to decreased urban-rural polarization. So my future as a political prognosticator may be limited. However, this was still a valuable coding challenge, and it’s given me firsthand experience with an important lesson: past performance is not a guarantee of future results."

    "text": "Analysis\nThese graphs present compelling evidence of anchoring bias. There are high peaks at 0 and 50 cents, as well as other round numbers such as multiples of 10 and 25.\nIf we look closer, another insight we get from these graphs is highs and lows both peak at rounded cent values, but they behave slightly different on how they approach to that peak. When approaching a daily high, traders keep buying until it reaches the 0 value, with lots of trades ending at 99 cents. Instead, when approaching a daily low, traders will buy at .01 and stop buying at .99. This behavior further reinforces the trend, as these barriers act as as support and tension price points.\nHowever, one of the concerns we had was that low volume stocks were driving this behavior. For example, some stocks can be as pricey as $200,000, and those stocks are usually traded at rounded numbers and by very few individuals. So we created two interactive shiny apps to allow users to view the trends of their choice. Unfortunately, Github will not host shinys, but we were able to host them remotely using shinyapps.io, and they can be accessed with the links below.\nFirst, we divided all stocks into five categories according to their median volume of daily trades. The user can explore the company size, metric and date of their choice.\naggregate shiny\nWhatever volume you look at, the trend generally maintains. People like rounded numbers and particularly .00 and .50.\nThe second shiny is for individual stocks. To keep the dropdown manageable, we limited the options to stocks from the S&P 500, minus the nine companies that did not appear in our dataset.\ns&p 500 shiny\nThanks for checking out our project! We hope you found it as interesting as we did."

In particular, YIMBYs have focused on rewriting the byzantine zoning codes which have long been a favored tool of “NIMBY” (Not In My BackYard) residents, who organize to stifle new development in their neighborhoods, citing concerns about traffic, noise and blocked views (Atlantic 2017).\nRecently, YIMBYs have scored notable successes in convincing several large cities to abolish exclusive single-family zoning, which only permits the construction of land-intensive single-family homes.

This policy was intended to have an outsize effect on the state’s largest city, Portland, where it’s easiest to increase housing density, and the city went along with the passage of its own Residential Infill Project the next year (Portland.gov 2023).

    "title": "Evaluating U.S. Zoning Policy Shifts: A Case Study in Portland, OR",
    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nTo begin the analysis, we first need to understand which parts of the city were most affected by the Residential Infill Project (RIP) zoning changes. The formerly single-family-exclusive zones (R2, R5, R7, R10, and R20) impacted by RIP are shown in the map below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this map of affected areas within Portland city limits, it is clear that RIP influences a substantial portion of the city. Based on the spatial distribution, we might expect to see the most noticeable changes along the central east-west corridor and throughout the southeastern neighborhoods, where these zones are heavily concentrated. To explore this further, we plot the geographic distribution of building permit applications over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermit activity (construction) appears to cluster in many of the same areas highlighted above, which aligns with expectations—new construction and additions would logically occur in locations where zoning rules were recently relaxed. However, despite the spatial alignment, the total number of permit applications actually decreased following RIP’s implementation. This decline is likely tied to its overlap with the COVID-19 pandemic, which slowed construction activity nationwide.\nGiven these dynamics, we next examine not only the volume and location of permits, but also the types of permits filed before and after RIP. The permit-share visualization below illustrates how the composition of permit applications shifted over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost 2020 and 2021 (RIP’s passing and implementation), we can see a significant shrinking in the share of single family homes in these new construction permits. We can also see the orange bars representing townhouses of 3 or more units grew substantially. This suggests that eliminating these exclusively single family zones may have had a large impact on the types of housing being invested in across the city. With multifamily housing supply increasing, we would expect slower housing price growth in accordance with the goal of the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows Portland’s average housing affordability over time, measured as the ratio of median household income to home values. Because a central goal of the policies was to expand housing supply and improve affordability, the figure helps assess whether conditions moved in that direction.\nAffordability declines sharply from 2015 to 2017 and reaches its lowest point just as HB 2001 is passed (red line). After that, affordability steadily improves for several years, suggesting a general easing of price pressures leading into 2020.\nFollowing the RIP announcement in August 2020 (blue line), affordability dips slightly again, potentially due to pandemic-era market dynamics. However, after the RIP’s implementation in August 2021, the trend reverses: affordability rises consistently and by 2025 returns to levels last seen in the mid-2010s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiving deeper into the decreasing ZIP-level variability observed in the previous plot, we examine whether improvements in affordability were shared across neighborhoods with different income and price levels. This figure tracks affordability at the 10th, 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of Portland ZIP codes.\nFor the median and 75th percentiles, affordability was highest in 2015 before declining through 2017. Post-RIP, these measures gradually recover and approach their earlier levels. In contrast, the 10th and 25th percentiles, representing the least affordable neighborhoods, show a notably stronger upward trajectory after the RIP’s implementation. These lower percentiles not only recover but actually surpass their 2015 values, reaching the highest affordability levels observed in the entire series.\nThis pattern indicates that recent improvements were not limited to already-advantaged areas, but the largest gains occurred in historically less affordable neighborhoods. While the analysis is descriptive and does not establish causality, the simultaneous upward shift across the distribution is consistent with a citywide easing of housing price pressures following the RIP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand how affordability changed across neighborhoods rather than only citywide averages, we mapped ZIP-level percent changes in affordability before and after the RIP implementation. Viewing the data spatially helps reveal whether improvements were broad-based or concentrated in only a few areas.\nThe map shows that most Portland ZIP codes experienced increases in affordability (shaded in green) when comparing the four-year period before RIP to the four years after implementation. Only a handful of ZIP codes show slight declines, and these are relatively small in magnitude. Several central ZIP codes stand out with large improvements exceeding 30%, indicating substantial relative gains in income-to-home-value ratios.\nAgain, while this does not identify causality, the spatial pattern suggests that post-RIP affordability improvements were widespread rather than isolated, aligning with the policy’s intention to expand housing options across many neighborhoods instead of affecting only a narrow set of areas.\nAnother important aspect of the affordability story is how Portland compares to other cities. Though HB 2001 affected the whole state, it was intended and expected to have an outsize impact on the major metro area. And indeed, so far the data bears this out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on the olive-green line, we can see that Portland’s home values/sale prices have risen less than those of other Oregonian cities, but the effect is not especially noticeable on the graph. However, in the raw numbers Portland’s home values have only risen by 19% since the passage of HB 2001, while the other 7 cities average around a 60% increase. And if we ignore single-family homes and zero in on just condos, an even more striking trend emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere the values of condos elsewhere continued to rise sharply, Portland’s have actually dropped since the passage of HB 2001. The simplest explanation seems to be that HB 2001 had an outsize impact on Portland, which was its intent. This also explains the discrepancy between single-family housing and condos, because the zoning reforms were targeted at increasing “missing middle” housing, which can be apartments for rent, but also includes condos for sale.\nHowever, an alternate explanation is that Portland has behaved differently from other cities in Oregon simply because it is much bigger - 4 times as populated as the next-largest (Salem and Eugene). And we discovered that large cities indeed had seen slower growth in home values than less urban areas.\n\n\nHome Value Changes (%)\n\n\nCity\nHome Values Since HB 2001\nHome Values Since RIP\n\n\n\n\nPortland\n+19.39%\n+14.84%\n\n\nSalem\n+72.2%\n+35.8%\n\n\nEugene\n+67.01%\n+35.57%\n\n\nGresham\n+49.29%\n+28.29%\n\n\nHillsboro\n+46.47%\n+27.26%\n\n\nBeaverton\n+46.78%\n+29.79%\n\n\nBend\n+74.37%\n+45.55%\n\n\nMedford\n+49.44%\n+29.3%\n\n\nMetropolis (Top 50)\n+64.91%\n+35.45%\n\n\nLarge (51-250)\n+73.16%\n+44.47%\n\n\nMedium (251-1000)\n+75.72%\n+48.27%\n\n\nSmall (1001+)\n+72.57%\n+44.52%\n\n\n\n\nThis table gives us perhaps the most complete picture of the impact of HB 2001 and the RIP. Three major takeaways: one, Portland’s home values (we’re looking at all homes again) have risen much less than the rest of the state, and the country. Two, home values in Oregon generally have seen depressed growth compared to the rest of the country. Three, the gap between Portland and other Oregonian cities is far greater than that between the biggest cities in the US and everywhere else. Going back to all homes, we can clearly see that the gap between Portland and the other 50 biggest in the country is much larger than that between the top 50 and everywhere else, though the latter gap is notable. These are all trends we would expect if the zoning reform was working as intended.\nFinally, the ultimate test is a counterfactual assessment: what would Portland’s home values have looked like without HB 2001 and the RIP? The best way to estimate this is by finding a control city, similar in many ways to Portland but without any major zoning reforms. And as it happens there’s a great candidate: Seattle. Seattle has a similar population, Pacific Northwest climate and progressive culture. While they’re currently planning a big zoning reform, likely inspired by Portland, they’ve historically devoted the large majority of their residential area to single-family homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd sure enough, their trends in home values mirror each other for 18 years, right up until we hit that red bar. This presents strong evidence that HB 2001 and the RIP have substantially contributed to keeping home values in Portland stable."

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nThis project set out to evaluate whether recent zoning reforms, specifically Oregon’s HB 2001 and Portland’s Residential Infill Project (RIP), have meaningfully advanced the goal of housing affordability by increasing supply. While debates over zoning reform often hinge on theory, Portland offers a rare opportunity to assess outcomes using several years of post-implementation data.\nOur findings suggest that HB 2001 and the RIP have been associated with modest improvements in housing affordability and a change in supply. Although overall permit volumes declined after the policy’s adoption, likely due to pandemic-era disruptions rather than zoning itself, construction activity remained spatially concentrated in areas newly changed by RIP. This indicates that the reform did, at minimum, succeed in directing development toward neighborhoods where single-family exclusivity had previously constrained supply. Along with this multifamily housing construction share increased heavily indicating not just single family housing was being put up in these areas.\nImportantly, affordability and pricing show a shift following HB 2001 and the RIP. After years of declining affordability driven by rapidly rising home values, Portland experienced a improvement in our affordability metric: ratio of median household income to home values. To contextualize these trends, we compared Portland’s home values with those of other cities. Unlike other cities in Oregon and around the country, which experienced sharp pandemic-era price increases, Portland’s home values were relatively stable. And the side-by-side comparison with Seattle, whose home values tracked Portland’s closely right up until the passage of HB 2001, presents strong evidence that the zoning change was a major factor.\nHowever, our findings are limited by the fact that real estate is a long-term game and we have relatively little data to work with. The past five years have been quite eventful, with a global pandemic, a volatile market and interest rates, macroeconomic policy changes, and much more, conditions that are difficult to control for. While we believe that HB 2001 and the RIP did have impact in tempering housing price growth in Portland, our analysis is largely descriptive rather than causal. We are optimistic about the impact of pro-density zoning reforms, but it is still too early for the YIMBY movement to declare victory."
