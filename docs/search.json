    "text": "Biography\nI was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I’d lived in Atlanta, Georgia nearly my entire life before returning to my Midwestern roots for college. I became interested in philosophy my first semester after taking an ethics class, and I soon decided to add data science to incorporate my diverse academic interests. This year, I spent a long semester in Amsterdam biking, museum-hopping and taking classes at the Vrije Universiteit, as well as exploring the rest of Europe, from Ireland to Istanbul. Since returning to the States, I’ve been working as a gardener, launching a Substack blog and thinking about my post-grad plan, as well as reading a lot and playing guitar in my spare time."
