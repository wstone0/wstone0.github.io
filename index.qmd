## Wesley Stone

Hi! I'm a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul studying data science and philosophy, with a cognitive science concentration. I'm primarily interested in the ethical problems posed by AI which lie at the confluence of these three fields, as well as metaethics, politics, and using data to answer important questions.

## Biography

I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I'd lived in Atlanta, Georgia nearly my entire life before returning to my Midwestern roots for college. I became interested in philosophy my first semester after taking an ethics class, and I soon decided to add data science to learn about the foundations of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, I spent a long semester in Amsterdam biking, museum-hopping and taking classes at the Vrije Universiteit, as well as exploring the rest of Europe, from Ireland (pictured above!) to Istanbul (check out some more pictures on the Photography page). This semester, I've been hard at work on capstone projects on the Repugnant Conclusion (philosophy) and Portland, OR's Residential Infill Plan (data science), as well as TAing for Intro Logic.
