## Wesley Stone

## Biography

I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I'd lived in Atlanta, Georgia nearly my entire life before returning to my Midwestern roots for college. I became interested in philosophy my first semester after taking an ethics class, and I soon decided to add data science to incorporate my diverse academic interests. With these two majors, my cognitive science concentration, and a study abroad semester next spring in Amsterdam that I'm very much looking forward to, my schedule is tight but I feel like it reflects the breadth of my passions. Outside of class, I enjoy reading, watching tv, and playing guitar.
