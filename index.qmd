## Wesley Stone

Hi! I'm a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul studying data science and philosophy. My interests are broad — ethics, politics, economics, the rapid rise of AI — but most recently I've done deep dives into population ethics and the effect of YIMBY policy reforms. As I prepare for graduation, I'm weighing the question of how to make long-term plans in a world so rapidly shifting.

## Biography

I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I'd lived in Atlanta, Georgia nearly my entire life before returning to my Midwestern roots for college. I became interested in philosophy my first semester after taking an ethics class, and I soon decided to add data science to explore the foundations of the machine learning and artificial intelligence technology taking the world by storm. Last spring, I spent a long semester in Amsterdam biking, museum-hopping and exploring the rest of Europe, from Ireland (pictured above!) to Istanbul (check out some more photos on the Photography page). This fall I was hard at work doing research and analysis for two capstone projects. For data science, I worked with a group to study the behavior of the Portland housing market after a statewide ban on exclusive single-family zoning. Our final paper is accessible on my website. And my philosophy capstone, entitled "A Risk-Sensitive Approach to Population Ethics," takes on the difficult question of how we should value a larger population. This paper is forthcoming in the journal [Dianoia](https://www.dianoiabc.org). In my final semester, I've taken on a quant-heavy schedule to prepare myself for postgrad work but have also returned to the class that sparked my philosophical interest as a preceptor (Macalester's version of a TA).
