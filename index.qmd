## Wesley Stone

Hi! I'm a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul studying data science and philosophy. My interests are broad — ethics, politics, the rapid rise of AI — but most recently I've done deep dives into population ethics and the effect of YIMBY policies on Portland, OR.

## Biography

I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I'd lived in Atlanta, Georgia nearly my entire life before returning to my Midwestern roots for college. I became interested in philosophy my first semester after taking an ethics class, and I soon decided to add data science to learn about the foundations of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, I spent a long semester in Amsterdam biking, museum-hopping and exploring the rest of Europe, from Ireland (pictured above!) to Istanbul (check out some more photos on the Photography page). This fall I was hard at work doing research and analysis for two capstone projects: one attempting to model the value of a larger population, and the other on the behavior of the Portland housing market after a statewide ban on exclusive single-family zoning, which you can check out on the Projects page.
