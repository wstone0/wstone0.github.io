## Wesley Stone

Hi! I'm a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul studying data science and philosophy, with a cognitive science concentration. I'm primarily interested in the ethical problems posed by AI which lie at the confluence of these three fields, as well as metaethics, data analysis and politics.

## Biography

I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I'd lived in Atlanta, Georgia nearly my entire life before returning to my Midwestern roots for college. I became interested in philosophy my first semester after taking an ethics class, and I soon decided to add data science to learn about the foundations of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This year, I spent a long semester in Amsterdam biking, museum-hopping and taking classes at the Vrije Universiteit, as well as exploring the rest of Europe, from Ireland to Istanbul. Since returning to the States, I've been working as a gardener, launching a Substack blog and thinking about my post-grad plan, as well as reading a lot and playing guitar in my spare time.
