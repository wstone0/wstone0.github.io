## Does white's advantage change with skill?

It's a well-known fact that playing the white pieces brings a small, but significant, advantage in a game of chess with its first move privilege. Generally, this is thought to translate to winning about 55% of non-draws in reasonably competitive environments. But I was interested in how much this advantage varies given the skill level of the players.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(chess)
```

This week's dataset consists of 20,000 games collected from Lichess.org. To analyze it, I first filtered out unrated games, so that hopefully most of the games left would represent genuine effort rather than just testing or having fun. Next, I created four (somewhat arbitrary) rating categories: Beginner (\<1200), Intermediate (1200-1600), Advanced (1600-2000), and Expert (\>2000). Then, all that was left was to calculate the win rates and put them in a bar chart.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
realchess <- chess[chess$rated, ]
realchess <- realchess %>%
  filter(winner != "draw") %>%
  mutate(whitewon = if_else(winner == "white", 1, 0))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
realchess <- realchess %>% 
  mutate(avg_rating = (white_rating + black_rating)/2) %>% 
  mutate(rate_cat = case_when(
    avg_rating < 1200 ~ "Beginner",
    1200 <= avg_rating & avg_rating < 1600 ~ "Intermediate",
    1600 <= avg_rating & avg_rating < 2000 ~ "Advanced",
    2000 <= avg_rating ~ "Expert"
  )) 

realchess <- realchess %>%
  mutate(rate_cat = factor(rate_cat, levels = c("Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced", "Expert")))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
realchess %>%
  group_by(rate_cat, whitewon) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(rate_cat) %>% 
  mutate(total_games = sum(n),
         win_rate_white = ifelse(whitewon == 1, n / total_games, 0)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(win_rate_white != 0) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = rate_cat, y = win_rate_white), stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "White Win % (excluding draws) by Player Rating", 
       x = "",
       y = "") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0.45, 0.55)) +
  theme_classic()  
```

## Conclusion

The result was quite surprising. Initially, I expected the starting advantage to increase with rating, because beginners will typically squander it fairly early with a major mistake, whereas grandmasters quite often can convert that half-pawn edge into a decisive lead. But in fact, the opposite occurs: white players below 1600 have about a 3% advantage, but by the time they reach 2000, it all but disappears. Why might this be? My initial reaction was that perhaps the matching algorithm automatically assigned white to the lower-ranked player, or else tried to adjust for the starting advantage, but the data does not bear this out:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
round(mean(realchess$white_rating))
round(mean(realchess$black_rating))

exchess <- realchess %>% 
  filter(rate_cat == "Expert") 

round(mean(exchess$white_rating))

round(mean(exchess$black_rating))
```

The first two numbers are the overall average ratings for both colors, and the second two represent the same for the experts; in both cases, they are practically identical. As the sample size is large, with over 15,000 games, there should be an explanation for even these modest differences in winrate. The only hypothesis I can come up with is that possibly at the highest levels, there's more experimentation, which means the white player might intentionally choose openings which erase their advantage for a more interesting game. If this is the case, the solution would be to find a dataset of tournament matches where the players almost certainly gave it their all. But as it stands, this analysis is sufficient to show that if you're queueing into Lichess at a ranking above 2000, you can't complain about losing the coin flip.
