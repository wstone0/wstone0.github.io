At a wet bulb (humidity-adjusted) temperature of 87Â°F, studies have shown that healthy young adults are at risk for severe symptoms with prolonged exposure. If this threshold were to be breached with any regularity, it would have profound implications for the way we could live our lives outdoors. For instance, municipal services, such as garbage collection, might have to be reduced or suspended in such a scenario. As such, Georgia Tech's Urban Climate Lab set out to answer the obvious question: when may this critical limit be reached? I assisted the Urban Climate Lab in acquiring, cleaning and wrangling the data for the Human Heat Tolerance Index, which tracks wet bulb temperatures in the 25 largest cities in the US. According to the [analysis](https://urbanclimate.gatech.edu/heat-risk/), over a dozen major metropolises may be at risk of threshold heat events within the decade.
